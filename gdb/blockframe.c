/* CUDA - inline frame support */
/*
   The lexical block information generated by the compiler for the sm_1x
   architectures is using an unusual convention: the inlined subroutine DIEs
   are attached to the parent routine DIE instead of the lexical block DIE
   where all the local variables are.

   Therefore, the GDB method of obtaining the block from the PC and walking up
   the block chain from there does not work. The lexical block with all the
   local variables is missed. As a result, we cannot access the local variables
   in the frames other than the innermost.

   To solve the issue, we use the more generic method:
     1. find the parent non-inlined function block
     2. iterate over all the blocks
     3. keep only the blocks whose first parent function block is the block
        found during step 1.
     4. find the narrowest block among those blocks, in terms of start and end
        address.

    This method guarantees that we will always find the local variables. The
    client will traverse the block chain up, starting from the block returned
    here.

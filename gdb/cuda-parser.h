/*CUDA COMMAND PARSER
 *
 * Entry point for complex CUDA commands not handled by the usual GDB command
 * interface.
 *
 * At this point, 3 types of "commands" are supported by the CUDA parser, as
 * defined by the enum type command_t:
 *   - focus query (Ex: "cuda block lane device")
 *   - focus switch (Ex: "cuda block 2 thread 3")
 *   - conditional expressions for native conditional breakpoints, as either a
 *     AND-product or a OR-product of conditions. (Ex: threadIdx.x == 2 &&
 *     blockIdx.x == 3)
 *
 * The result of the parsing is passed as an array of request_t objects, where
 * each object represents a single request (or condition). A request applies to
 * a single type of coordinates (coord_type_t). It can be the device index, or
 * the blockIdx.x variable for instance. Given that coordinate, the request can
 * be of different types: same or exact. Same means that the value is the one in
 * the current focus. Exact means that the value is the one specified in the
 * value field of the request. Finally the cmp field indicates with comparison
 * operator to use for that coordinate, and the next field points to the next
 * request.
 *
 *   Example:
 *         type    = COORD_TYPE_BLOCK
 *         request = REQ_SAME, REQ_EXACT, REQ_NONE
 *         value   = { -1, 3, -1 }
 *         cmp     = CMP_LE
 *     translates to
 *         'block <= (n, 3)' where n is the current blockIdx.x
 *
 * With the switch and AND-product commands, ALL the requests must be met. With
 * the OR-product commands, ANY request must be met for the list of requests to
 * be valid.

# Similar to gdb.sh (original), but without system search paths and
# architecture translation.

# gdb is setgid procmod and dyld will truncate any DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH etc
# settings on exec.  The user is really trying to set these things
# in their process, not gdb.  So we smuggle it over the setgid border in
# GDB_DYLD_* where it'll be laundered inside gdb before invoking the inferior.
